  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <h3>What is Progressive Enhancement?</h>
    <p>
      Progressive Enhancement is the process of how content and the functions of a website are prioritized so that usability and accessibility are available on different browsers and devices. Developers first create a basic, universal website that focuses on the core content and semantics. Then, they begin adding CSS and Javascript layers to create a better experience for the end user. They make sure that old browsers can still function but still create dynamic websites for modern browsers. 
    </p>
  <h3>Why is progressive enhancement important in modern web development?</h3>
  <p>
    This is important for modern web development because it allows websites to be accessible to more people no matter the browser or device being used. You are also able to change your website more easily since your foundation is already built (HTML), you can redesign your website in order to keep up with demands of your client or business and create search optimization.

      <p>There is no fee for entry to an Arkansas state park, although tour fees are charged for access to some facilities. A wide variety of activities can be enjoyed at no cost in the parks including hiking, mountain biking, picnicking, launching a boat, and participating in most of the interpretive programs. You can enjoy the museums and their collections (exception is Historic Washington State Park) at no charge. However, a variety of fees are charged in the parks for the rental of facilities such as campsites, cabins, lodge guest rooms; dining; participating in certain activities such as guided horseback rides; specific interpretive programs led by park interpreters; and special events. </p>

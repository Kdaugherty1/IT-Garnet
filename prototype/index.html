          The University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UA Little Rock) is a public
          research university in Little Rock, Arkansas. Established as Little
          Rock Junior College by the Little Rock School District in 1927, the
          institution became a private four-year university under the name
          Little Rock University in 1957. It returned to public status in 1969
          when it merged with the University of Arkansas System under its
          present name. The former campus of Little Rock Junior College is now
          (2019) the campus of Philander Smith University.
        </p>

          56 buildings, including the Center for Nanotechnology Integrative
          Sciences, the Emerging Analytics Center, the Sequoyah Research Center,

          The student life at UA Little Rock is typical of public universities
          in the United States. It is characterized by student-run organizations
          and affiliation groups that support social, academic, athletic, and
          religious activities and interests. Some of the services offered by
          the UA Little Rock Office of Campus Life are intramural sports and
          fitness programs, diversity programs, leadership development, peer
          tutoring, student government association, student support programs
          including groups for non-traditional and first-generation students, a
          student-run newspaper, and fraternity and sorority life. The proximity
          of the UA Little Rock campus to downtown Little Rock enables students
          to take advantage of a wide array of recreational, entertainment,
          educational, internship, and employment opportunities that are not
          available anywhere else in Arkansas.

            wrestling (Pac-12 Conference), neither of which the Sun Belt
            sponsors. Wrestling is the school's newest sport, starting in 2019,
